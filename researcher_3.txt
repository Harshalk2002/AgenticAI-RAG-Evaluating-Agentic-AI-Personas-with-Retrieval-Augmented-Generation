The key components of the Transformer architecture are:
1. **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating an output.
2. **Encoder**: Composed of a stack of identical layers, each with two sub-layers - a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network.
3. **Decoder**: Also composed of a stack of identical layers, with three sub-layers - a multi-head self-attention mechanism, a multi-head attention mechanism over the encoder's output, and a feed-forward neural network.
4. **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously by projecting the input into multiple subspaces and computing attention in each subspace.
5. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks**: Used in both the encoder and decoder layers to apply a simple feed-forward neural network to each position separately.
6. **Positional Encodings**: Added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of tokens in the sequence.
7. **Layer Normalization**: Applied after each sub-layer and before the residual connection in both the encoder and decoder to improve training speed and stability.
8. **Residual Connections**: Include skip connections around each sub-layer to help with training deep networks by allowing gradients to flow directly through the network.
9. **Feed-Forward Neural Networks**: Used to process the output of the attention mechanism in both the encoder and decoder layers.
10. **Softmax Function**: Applied to the output of the decoder to generate a probability distribution over the target vocabulary for sequence generation tasks.
