We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\u001B[00m\n"

In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is\n",

      "In this article, we’ll explore the basics of two data science approaches: supervised and unsupervised. Find out which approach is right for your situation.\n",
      "The world is getting “smarter” every day, and to keep up with consumer expectations, companies are increasingly using machine learning algorithms to make things easier. You can see them in use in end-user devices (through face recognition for unlocking smartphones) or for detecting credit card fraud (like triggering alerts for unusual purchases).\n",
      "Within  artificial intelligence  (AI) and  machine learning , there are two basic approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The main difference is that one uses labeled data to help predict outcomes, while the other does not. However, there are some nuances between the two approaches, and key areas in which one outperforms the other. This post clarifies the differences so you can choose the best approach for your situation.\n",
      "What is supervised learning?\n",
      "Supervised learning  is a machine learning approach that’s defined by its use of labeled data sets. These data sets are designed to train or “supervise” algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. Using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time.\n",
      "Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when  data mining : classification and regression:\n",
      "Classification  problems use an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories, such as separating apples from oranges. Or, in the real world, supervised learning algorithms can be used to classify spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Linear classifiers, support vector machines, decision trees and  random forest  are all common types of classification algorithms. Regression  is another type of supervised learning method that uses an algorithm to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression models are helpful for predicting numerical values based on different data points, such as sales revenue projections for a given business. Some popular regression algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, and polynomial regression.\n",
      "What is unsupervised learning?\n",
      "Unsupervised learning  uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are “unsupervised”).\n",
      "Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association and dimensionality reduction:\n",
      "Clustering  is a data mining technique for grouping unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. For example, K-means clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where the K value represents the size of the grouping and granularity. This technique is helpful for market segmentation, image compression, and so on. Association  is another type of unsupervised learning method that uses different rules to find relationships between variables in a given data set. These methods are frequently used for market basket analysis and recommendation engines, along the lines of “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought” recommendations. Dimensionality reduction  is a learning technique that is used when the number of features (or dimensions) in a given data set is too high. It reduces the number of data inputs to a manageable size while also preserving the data integrity. Often, this technique is used in the preprocessing data stage, such as when autoencoders remove noise from visual data to improve picture quality.\n",

      "The main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning: Labeled data\n",
      "The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled data sets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.\n",
      "In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training data set by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you must train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time.\n",
      "Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce, and sippy cups.\n",
      "Other key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
      "Goals:  In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is different or interesting from the data set. Applications: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam detection, sentiment analysis, weather forecasting and pricing predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised learning is a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer personas and medical imaging. Complexity:  Supervised learning is a simple method for machine learning, typically calculated by using programs like R or Python. In unsupervised learning, you need powerful tools for working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised learning models are computationally complex because they need a large training set to produce intended outcomes. Drawbacks: Supervised learning models can be time-consuming to train, and the labels for input and output variables require expertise. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods can have wildly inaccurate results unless you have human intervention to validate the output variables.\n",
      "Supervised versus unsupervised learning: Which is best for you?\n",
      "Choosing the right approach for your situation depends on how your data scientists assess the structure and volume of your data, as well as the use case. To make your decision, be sure to do the following:\n",
      "Evaluate your input data:  Is it labeled or unlabeled data? Do you have experts that can support extra labeling? Define your goals:  Do you have a recurring, well-defined problem to solve? Or will the algorithm need to predict new problems? Review your options for algorithms:  Are there algorithms with the same dimensionality that you need (number of features, attributes, or characteristics)? Can they support your data volume and structure?\n",
      "Classifying big data can be a real challenge in supervised learning, but the results are highly accurate and trustworthy. In contrast, unsupervised learning can handle large volumes of data in real time. But, there’s a lack of transparency into how data is clustered and a higher risk of inaccurate results. This is where semi-supervised learning comes in.\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning: The best of both worlds\n",
      "Can’t decide on whether to use supervised or unsupervised learning?  Semi-supervised learning  is a happy medium, where you use a training data set with both labeled and unlabeled data. It’s particularly useful when it’s difficult to extract relevant features from data—and when you have a high volume of data.\n",
      "Semi-supervised learning is ideal for medical images, where a small amount of training data can lead to a significant improvement in accuracy. For example, a radiologist can label a small subset of CT scans for tumors or diseases so the machine can more accurately predict which patients might require more medical attention.\n",

      "In this article from IBM, the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is explained. Supervised learning uses labeled data sets to train algorithms for classification and regression tasks, while unsupervised learning analyzes and clusters unlabeled data to discover patterns. Supervised learning is ideal for predicting outcomes with labeled data, while unsupervised learning is great for getting insights from large data volumes. The article also discusses the goals, applications, complexity, and drawbacks of both approaches, highlighting the importance of evaluating data structure, defining goals, and reviewing algorithm options when choosing between supervised and unsupervised learning. Additionally, the article introduces semi-supervised learning as a hybrid approach that combines labeled and unlabeled data for improved accuracy in scenarios where relevant features are challenging to extract.\u001B[00m\n",

In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2 Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet.

      "Customizing LLMs: When to Choose LoRA or Full Fine-Tuning\n",
      "Posted by Ben Lorica May 20, 2024 May 20, 2024 Posted in Uncategorized\n",
      "The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) has spurred a demand for customization to suit specific tasks and domains. As I’ve noted in previous work , tailoring LLMs to unique needs can significantly enhance performance and cost-efficiency, particularly when striving for higher accuracy in specific applications.\n",
      "Fine-tuning has some advantages over prompt engineering, or training from scratch. Click HERE to enlarge.\n",
      "Fine-tuning LLMs allows developers to adapt pre-trained models to their unique requirements, ultimately improving performance and cost-efficiency. With the emergence of user-friendly fine-tuning services , teams can now focus on curating high-quality datasets rather than grappling with the intricacies of fine-tuning implementation.\n",
      "Two popular fine-tuning techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation ( LoRA ) and full fine-tuning, offer distinct approaches to adapting LLMs. LoRA is a parameter-efficient method that trains only low-rank perturbations to selected weight matrices, while full fine-tuning optimizes all model parameters. To help teams make informed decisions when using fine-tuning services, two recent studies provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques.\n",
      "Key Findings from the Studies\n",
      "Two recent studies, one conducted by Anyscale and another by Columbia/Databricks , offer valuable insights into the performance of LoRA and full fine-tuning across different domains and datasets. Both studies consistently found that full fine-tuning generally outperforms LoRA in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency, particularly in complex domains such as programming and mathematics. However, the performance gap between the two methods varies depending on the specific task and dataset.\n",
      "Interestingly, the studies also highlight LoRA’s role as a regularizer, mitigating the “forgetting” of the source domain often observed in fine-tuning. LoRA maintains the base model’s performance on tasks outside the target domain better than full fine-tuning, demonstrating stronger regularization compared to techniques like weight decay and attention dropout. This property makes LoRA a compelling choice for applications where preserving the model’s generalizability is paramount.\n",
      "LoRA preserves model generalizability by mitigating ‘forgetting’ of the source domain\n",
      "The decision between LoRA and full fine-tuning is not always straightforward and depends on factors such as resource constraints, task complexity, and the desired balance between accuracy and efficiency. The studies suggest that LoRA is more suitable for instruction fine-tuning (IFT) scenarios with smaller datasets, while full fine-tuning excels in continued pretraining (CPT) with large datasets. Teams must carefully evaluate their specific requirements and prioritize the most effective approach accordingly.\n",
      "Recommendations for Teams Using Fine-Tuning Services\n",
      "Based on the findings of the two studies, teams leveraging fine-tuning services to adapt LLMs can benefit from the following recommendations:\n",
      "Prioritize full fine-tuning for applications demanding the highest accuracy, particularly in complex domains like programming and mathematics. Full fine-tuning’s superior performance and sample efficiency make it the optimal choice when accuracy is paramount.\n",
      "Consider LoRA for applications where you need the model to perform well on multiple related tasks (e.g., summarizing text and translating languages). LoRA’s regularization properties help prevent overfitting and reduce the “forgetting” of the source domain, ensuring the model remains versatile.\n",
      "Focus on using LoRA for instruction fine-tuning (IFT) scenarios with relatively small datasets. LoRA performs better with smaller, task-specific datasets compared to large continued pretraining (CPT) datasets.\n",
      "Consider using LoRA when you’re fine-tuning the model for a specific task using a relatively small dataset of examples. LoRA performs better in these scenarios compared to situations where you’re using a large dataset to further train the model on a broader range of tasks.\n",
      "(Click HERE to enlarge)\n",
      "For teams deeply involved in implementing fine-tuning, the following additional considerations can help optimize LoRA performance:\n",
      "Optimize hyperparameters, particularly learning rates, for maximum performance. LoRA is highly sensitive to learning rates, and finding the optimal rate through experimentation is crucial for stable and effective training.\n",
      "Target all relevant modules (attention, MLP) with LoRA for optimal performance. Comprehensive adaptation of the model yields better results compared to targeting only specific modules.\n",
      "Choose the rank in LoRA based on available memory, with a rank of 16 serving as a good starting point. The choice of rank involves a trade-off between performance and memory requirements, and teams should consider their hardware limitations and desired accuracy.\n",
      "Train LoRA models for a sufficient number of epochs, with at least four epochs recommended for optimal performance. While LoRA’s performance improves with longer training, it remains less sample-efficient than full fine-tuning.\n",
      "Closing Thoughts\n",
      "The insights from the Anyscale and Columbia/Databricks studies provide valuable guidance for teams navigating the complex landscape of fine-tuning LLMs. By understanding the strengths and limitations of LoRA and full fine-tuning, developers can make informed decisions when using fine-tuning services to adapt models to their specific needs. This understanding allows developers to carefully consider factors such as task complexity, resource constraints, and the desired balance between accuracy and efficiency, ultimately enabling them to harness the power of fine-tuning to build highly effective and customized AI applications.\n",
      "Moving forward, further research into the impact of model size, task complexity, and domain shift on the effectiveness of fine-tuning methods will provide even more granular insights. As fine-tuning services continue to improve and new techniques emerge, teams will have an ever-expanding toolkit to adapt LLMs to their unique requirements, driving innovation and unlocking new possibilities.\n",
      "The landscape of model fine-tuning is being reshaped by two exciting trends: multi-modal foundation models and the rise of agents and Agentic AI. Multi-modal models that can process text, images, audio and other data types open up new frontiers for fine-tuning. Meanwhile, the emergence of Agentic AI , where AI systems autonomously pursue goals, will demand sophisticated fine-tuning approaches to ensure these agents can effectively learn and adapt in complex environments. Integrating fine-tuning techniques with these trends promises to unlock even greater potential for advanced AI systems.\n",

      "Customizing LLMs: When to Choose LoRA or Full Fine-Tuning\n",
      "Posted by Ben Lorica May 20, 2024 May 20, 2024 Posted in Uncategorized\n",
      "The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) has spurred a demand for customization to suit specific tasks and domains. As I’ve noted in previous work, tailoring LLMs to unique needs can significantly enhance performance and cost-efficiency, particularly when striving for higher accuracy in specific applications.\n",
      "Fine-tuning has some advantages over prompt engineering, or training from scratch. Click HERE to enlarge.\n",
      "Fine-tuning LLMs allows developers to adapt pre-trained models to their unique requirements, ultimately improving performance and cost-efficiency. With the emergence of user-friendly fine-tuning services, teams can now focus on curating high-quality datasets rather than grappling with the intricacies of fine-tuning implementation.\n",
      "Two popular fine-tuning techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and full fine-tuning, offer distinct approaches to adapting LLMs. LoRA is a parameter-efficient method that trains only low-rank perturbations to selected weight matrices, while full fine-tuning optimizes all model parameters. To help teams make informed decisions when using fine-tuning services, two recent studies provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques.\n",
      "Key Findings from the Studies\n",
      "Two recent studies, one conducted by Anyscale and another by Columbia/Databricks, offer valuable insights into the performance of LoRA and full fine-tuning across different domains and datasets. Both studies consistently found that full fine-tuning generally outperforms LoRA in terms of accuracy and sample efficiency, particularly in complex domains such as programming and mathematics. However, the performance gap between the two methods varies depending on the specific task and dataset.\n",
      "Interestingly, the studies also highlight LoRA’s role as a regularizer, mitigating the “forgetting” of the source domain often observed in fine-tuning. LoRA maintains the base model’s performance on tasks outside the target domain better than full fine-tuning, demonstrating stronger regularization compared to techniques like weight decay and attention dropout. This property makes LoRA a compelling choice for applications where preserving the model’s generalizability is paramount.\n",
      "The decision between LoRA and full fine-tuning is not always straightforward and depends on factors such as resource constraints, task complexity, and the desired balance between accuracy and efficiency. The studies suggest that LoRA is more suitable for instruction fine-tuning (IFT) scenarios with smaller datasets, while full fine-tuning excels in continued pretraining (CPT) with large datasets. Teams must carefully evaluate their specific requirements and prioritize the most effective approach accordingly.\n",
      "Recommendations for Teams Using Fine-Tuning Services\n",
      "Based on the findings of the two studies, teams leveraging fine-tuning services to adapt LLMs can benefit from the following recommendations:\n",
      "Prioritize full fine-tuning for applications demanding the highest accuracy, particularly in complex domains like programming and mathematics. Full fine-tuning’s superior performance and sample efficiency make it the optimal choice when accuracy is paramount.\n",
      "Consider LoRA for applications where you need the model to perform well on multiple related tasks (e.g., summarizing text and translating languages). LoRA’s regularization properties help prevent overfitting and reduce the “forgetting” of the source domain, ensuring the model remains versatile.\n",
      "Focus on using LoRA for instruction fine-tuning (IFT) scenarios with relatively small datasets. LoRA performs better with smaller, task-specific datasets compared to large continued pretraining (CPT) datasets.\n",
      "Consider using LoRA when you’re fine-tuning the model for a specific task using a relatively small dataset of examples. LoRA performs better in these scenarios compared to situations where you’re using a large dataset to further train the model on a broader range of tasks.\n",
      "For teams deeply involved in implementing fine-tuning, the following additional considerations can help optimize LoRA performance:\n",
      "Optimize hyperparameters, particularly learning rates, for maximum performance. LoRA is highly sensitive to learning rates, and finding the optimal rate through experimentation is crucial for stable and effective training.\n",
      "Target all relevant modules (attention, MLP) with LoRA for optimal performance. Comprehensive adaptation of the model yields better results compared to targeting only specific modules.\n",
      "Choose the rank in LoRA based on available memory, with a rank of 16 serving as a good starting point. The choice of rank involves a trade-off between performance and memory requirements, and teams should consider their hardware limitations and desired accuracy.\n",
      "Train LoRA models for a sufficient number of epochs, with at least four epochs recommended for optimal performance. While LoRA’s performance improves with longer training, it remains less sample-efficient than full fine-tuning\u001B[00m\n",

A notable example is PayPal, which uses machine learning to fight fraud by analyzing billions of transactions. More details on their approach can be found on their official site or trusted financial technology news sources. Moreover, the integration of AI in fraud detection not only improves the accuracy but also reduces the time taken to detect fraud, thereby minimizing the risk and potential losses. The future of fraud detection lies in the continuous improvement of these AI models and the integration of newer technologies like deep learning and predictive analytics. For further reading, websites like Forbes and IBM offer insights into how AI and machine learning are being leveraged for fraud detection. 5.3.2. Algorithmic Trading Algorithmic trading, also known as algo-trading, uses computer programs that follow a defined set of instructions to place trades in order to generate profits at a speed and frequency that is impossible for a human trader. The use of algorithms in trading has significantly increased the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets. These algorithms can analyze market data at an incredible speed to execute trades based on market conditions that meet predetermined criteria. For example, high-frequency trading (HFT) is a form of algorithmic trading that involves buying and selling securities at extremely high speeds. Firms engaged in HFT often operate with extremely low latency responses, nearly in real-time, and have an immense capacity to process high volumes of trades. The impact of HFT on market quality is often debated, but there is no denying its significance in the current trading landscape. The future of algorithmic trading will likely see more sophisticated algorithms that can better simulate human decision-making processes and incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve predictive capabilities. For those interested in exploring more about how algorithmic trading is shaping financial markets, resources like Investopedia and the Financial Times provide comprehensive analyses and examples. 6. Future Trends and Predictions The future of technology and business is incredibly dynamic, with new trends constantly emerging. Predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are just a few areas that are expected to drive significant change. Predictive analytics, for example, is becoming more sophisticated and is widely used in industries from healthcare to retail to anticipate customer behaviors, manage risk, and optimize operational efficiency. Artificial intelligence continues to be at the forefront of technological innovation. Its applications are expanding into everyday life, from personal AI assistants to advanced systems that can diagnose diseases faster than human doctors. AI's role in business, particularly through automation and data analysis, is also set to increase its impact on productivity and decision-making processes. Blockchain technology, initially developed for digital currencies like Bitcoin, is finding new applications in areas such as supply chain management, where it can help in tracking the authenticity and status of products as they move through various stages of delivery. As these technologies evolve, they will create new opportunities and challenges for businesses and consumers alike. For those looking to stay ahead of the curve, keeping an eye on technology news platforms like TechCrunch or Wired can provide valuable insights into the latest trends and predictions in the tech world. 6.1. Technological Innovations Technological innovations continue to reshape industries, driving growth and creating new opportunities. In sectors like healthcare, automotive, and finance, advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain are revolutionizing operations. For instance, AI is being leveraged to enhance diagnostic accuracy in healthcare and improve customer service through chatbots in finance. IoT technology is pivotal in automotive industries for developing connected cars that enhance user experience and safety. The integration of these technologies leads to increased efficiency and cost reduction. However, it also requires significant investment in research and development (R&D) to stay competitive. Companies like Tesla and Amazon are leading examples of how continuous innovation fosters market leadership. Teslaâ€™s innovations in electric vehicles and battery technology have disrupted the automotive industry, while Amazonâ€™s use of AI and machine learning in logistics has set new standards for retail and supply chain management. 6.2. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations As technology advances, regulatory and ethical considerations become increasingly important to ensure these innovations benefit society while minimizing harm. Data privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical AI are some of the key areas where regulations are being developed. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. are examples of regulations aimed at protecting personal information. Ethical considerations are particularly significant in AI, where issues such as bias and decision-making transparency are debated. Organizations like the AI Now Institute are focused on understanding the social implications of AI technologies and developing guidelines to ensure ethical practices. Moreover, as genetic engineering and biotechnology rapidly evolve, ethical debates intensify around topics like gene editing and cloning. For more insights into regulatory and ethical considerations in technology, you can explore resources at Harvard Law School's blog and The Center for Internet and Society. 6.3. Market Dynamics Market dynamics are critical in understanding the shifts in various industries due to changes in supply and demand, technological advancements, and global economic conditions. These dynamics can influence pricing, product development, and consumer behavior. For example, the rise of renewable energy sources has impacted the oil and gas industry by reducing demand for traditional energy sources and altering global energy markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly affected market dynamics, accelerating the shift towards digital services and e-commerce, while industries like travel and hospitality have faced unprecedented challenges. Understanding these dynamics helps businesses adapt their strategies to meet changing market demands and to capitalize on emerging opportunities.

      "Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SparseK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SparseK , to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SparseK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SparseK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications. Our code will be publicly available.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Transformer modelsÂ  [ 72 ] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation modelsÂ  [ 8 , 21 ] , and more recently, constructing large language modelsÂ (LLMs) Â  [ 9 , 69 ] . Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory\n",
      "efficiently poses significant challengesÂ  [ 1 , 20 , 19 ] , owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices.\n",
      "Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths.\n",
      "However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks:\n",
      "(i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs . Clustering-based methodsÂ  [ 39 , 61 ] allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inferenceÂ  [ 81 , 42 , 78 ] .\n",
      "(ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity , especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually cost O â�¢ ( n â�¢ log â�¡ n ) ğ�‘‚ ğ�‘› ğ�‘› O(n\\log n) italic_O ( italic_n roman_log italic_n ) to maintain clusters. Ainslie etÂ al. [ 1 ] incorporates a SoftTopK operatorÂ  [ 41 ] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SoftTopK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SoftTopK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total.\n",
      "To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention , an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in FigureÂ  1 . Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- k ğ�‘˜ k italic_k mask operator SparseK , which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time.\n",
      "It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- k ğ�‘˜ k italic_k attentionÂ  [ 32 , 1 ] . Unfortunately, conventional top- k ğ�‘˜ k italic_k attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network.\n",
      "With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SparseK attention as follows.\n",
      "Incremental KV Selection.\n",
      "The SparseK operator ( Â§ Â§ \\S Â§ Â  3.3 ) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder.\n",
      "Besides, compared with SoftTopK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5Â  [ 1 ] , our operator computes the exact operation results.\n",
      "Computational and Memory Efficiency. SparseK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methodsÂ  [ 65 , 32 , 2 , 47 ] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference.\n",
      "This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference.\n",
      "Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediatelyÂ ( Â§ Â§ \\S Â§ Â  3.2 ).\n",
      "Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttentionÂ  [ 20 ] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SparseK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency.\n",
      "Figure 1 : Left: SparseK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by ğ��® ğ��® \\mathbf{u} bold_u . SparseK computes a threshold for each query ( Ï„ â�¢ ( ğ��® ) ğ�œ� ğ��® \\tau(\\mathbf{u}) italic_Ï„ ( bold_u ) ) such that the sum of normalized scores is k ğ�‘˜ k italic_k , which is 3 in this example. We select top- k ğ�‘˜ k italic_k KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SparseK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency.\n",
      "We verify the advantages of SparseK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2Â  [ 57 ] and PythiaÂ  [ 6 ] ) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments on language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention.\n",

      "Long-range Transformers\n",
      "Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space modelsÂ  [ 30 , 62 ] , recurrent neural networksÂ  [ 45 , 52 , 49 ] , linear attentionÂ  [ 55 , 38 ] and low-rank approximations of self-attentionÂ  [ 75 , 14 , 53 ] , which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer modelsÂ  [ 70 ] in language modeling tasks until recent effortsÂ  [ 29 , 77 ] . Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrenceÂ  [ 17 , 35 , 36 , 12 ] or key-value compressionÂ  [ 60 , 59 , 18 ] .\n",
      "In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditionsÂ  [ 15 , 27 , 42 ] .\n",
      "Sparse attention\n",
      "Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windowsÂ  [ 56 , 51 ] , dilated sliding windowsÂ  [ 4 , 22 ] , combination of patternsÂ  [ 34 , 13 ] , or domain-specific patternsÂ  [ 31 ] .\n",
      "Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policiesÂ  [ 81 , 42 , 27 ] . However, these static methods often prove suboptimal in various scenariosÂ  [ 66 , 2 ] . Alternatively, sparse patterns can be learned in a data-driven manner. For example, ReformerÂ  [ 39 ] employs locality-sensitive hashing for token clustering and do attention within a cluster, while Routing TransformersÂ  [ 61 ] , Cluster-FormerÂ  [ 74 ] and Clustered AttentionÂ  [ 73 ] use K-Means clustering on tokens. Besides, Sparse Sinkhorn AttentionÂ  [ 68 ] establishes sparsity by sorting blocks of inputs. Despite achieving sub-quadratic complexity, these methods still remain above linear complexity and face challenges when handling extremely long sequences or failing to offer constant memory cost during inference. A recent approach by Anagnostidis etÂ al. [ 2 ] introduces a learnable, irreversible key-value pair pruning for inference-time memory efficiency with the concept of relaxing pruning actions to accumulated gating. However, this method still suffers from quadratic complexity during training, hindering its ability to expedite the training process. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient sparse attention mechanism with learnable patterns, addressing all the aforementioned challenges.\n",

      "Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SparseK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SparseK , to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SparseK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SparseK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications. Our code will be publicly available.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Transformer models [ 72 ] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [ 8 , 21 ] , and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [ 9 , 69 ] . Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory\n",
      "efficiently poses significant challenges [ 1 , 20 , 19 ] , owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices.\n",
      "Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths.\n",
      "However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks:\n",
      "(i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs . Clustering-based methods [ 39 , 61 ] allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [ 81 , 42 , 78 ] .\n",
      "(ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity , especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually cost O ( n log n ) O(n\\log n) to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [ 1 ] incorporates a SoftTopK operator [ 41 ] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SoftTopK\u001B[00m\n",
