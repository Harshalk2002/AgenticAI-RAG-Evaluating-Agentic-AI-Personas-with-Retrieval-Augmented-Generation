LoRA improves efficiency in fine-tuning large language models compared to full fine-tuning by being a parameter-efficient method that trains only low-rank perturbations to selected weight matrices. This means that LoRA focuses on adjusting specific parts of the pre-trained model rather than optimizing all model parameters, which can lead to faster training times and reduced computational resources required. Additionally, LoRA acts as a regularizer, helping to prevent overfitting and maintain the model's generalizability by preserving performance on tasks outside the target domain. This regularization property of LoRA can lead to improved efficiency in scenarios where the model needs to perform well on multiple related tasks without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model.
