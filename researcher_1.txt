The transformer architecture introduced in the 'Attention is All You Need' paper is a neural network model that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms to compute representations of input and output sequences. This architecture is designed to address the limitations of traditional sequence-to-sequence models like RNNs and LSTMs by eliminating recurrent connections and instead using self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between input and output tokens.

The transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both composed of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows each token in the sequence to attend to all other tokens in the sequence, capturing long-range dependencies efficiently.

The key components of the transformer architecture include multi-head self-attention mechanisms, feed-forward neural networks, layer normalization, and residual connections. By stacking multiple layers of these components, the transformer model can learn complex patterns in the input sequences and generate accurate outputs.

Overall, the transformer architecture has shown superior performance in various natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and language modeling, and has become a foundational model in the field of deep learning.
