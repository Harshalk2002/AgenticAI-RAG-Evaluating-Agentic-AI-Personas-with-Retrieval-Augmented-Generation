# AgenticAI-RAG: Evaluating Agentic AI Personas with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be used to simulate and evaluate different agentic AI personas—such as journalists and researchers—based on personalized knowledge inputs. The evaluation explores how well AI-generated responses align with persona traits, factual grounding, and style.
